# Pyon Versioning

## Current Version: 0.2.5-alpha

### Status
Alpha (Mature)

### Overview

This version introduces a major redesign of the `File` system in Pyon, modularizing it as an independent submodule (`pyon.file`) and refactoring its interface to offer a unified, expressive, and Pythonic API.  
It replaces the deprecated `fetch` flag with the explicit `export_mode`, formalizes memory management via `load()` and `unload()`, and adds extensive metadata support.  
The module now supports temporary file handling, streaming access, file existence checks, and rich comparison semantics.  
A dedicated README for the submodule was created, aligning with professional module documentation standards.  
This release also formalizes the MIME type for `.pyon` files as `application/vnd.pyon+json`, with the IANA registration process archived.

### Key Features in 0.2.5-alpha

- ‚úÖ Replaced `fetch` with `export_mode: Literal["reference", "data"]`.
- ‚úÖ Modularized `file.py` into its own package: `pyon.file`.
- ‚úÖ Redesigned `File` constructor to support `path`, `content`, `mime`, and `export_mode`.
- ‚úÖ Replaced constructor logic in `from_dict()` with `__new__()` to ensure deserialization neutrality.
- ‚úÖ Added support for temporary files via `_write_temp()` and `_tmp_path`.
- ‚úÖ Added explicit memory control methods: `load()` and `unload()`.
- ‚úÖ Implemented file state properties: `loaded`, `temp`, and `status`.
- ‚úÖ Added metadata accessors: `name`, `extension`, `directory`, and `exists`.
- ‚úÖ Introduced `__len__()` and redesigned `size` to return human-readable strings.
- ‚úÖ Added comparison operators (`==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) for content or size.
- ‚úÖ Introduced `from_url()` class method to create `File` from remote sources.
- ‚úÖ Added `stream()` and `to_stream()` methods for reading content by lines or chunks.
- ‚úÖ Defined official MIME type: `application/vnd.pyon+json`.
- ‚úÖ Created standalone README for the `pyon.file` submodule.
- ‚úÖ Archived IANA media type registration form in `docs/other/iana-registration.md`.

### Tasks Completed for This Version

#### ‚úÖ File Object Refactor
- [x] Replace `fetch` with `export_mode: Literal["reference", "data"]`
- [x] Redesign constructor interface to accept `path`, `content`, `mime`, and `export_mode`
- [x] Use `__new__` in `from_dict()` to bypass `__init__`, preserving deserialization neutrality
- [x] Update `to_dict()` to include content only when `export_mode == "data"`

#### ‚úÖ Temporary File Support
- [x] Add `_write_temp()` to write content to a temporary file
- [x] Add `_tmp_path` tracking for temporary file location
- [x] Update `load()` to prioritize loading from temporary file if present
- [x] Add `unload()` method to discard memory content and persist to file or temp location

#### ‚úÖ Interface Improvements
- [x] Add `__len__()` to return raw byte size
- [x] Redefine `size` to return formatted size string (e.g., "3.1 MB")
- [x] Add `name`, `extension`, `directory` properties
- [x] Add `loaded` and `temp` state properties
- [x] Implement comparison operators: `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`

#### ‚úÖ MIME Type and IANA Registration
- [x] Define MIME type as `application/vnd.pyon+json`
- [x] Add section to README specifying MIME type and usage
- [x] Prepare full registration form for IANA media type registry
- [x] Archive registration info in `docs/other/iana-registration.md`

#### ‚úÖ Modularization and Isolation
- [x] Create `pyon.file` as its own module directory
- [x] Move implementation from `file.py` to `pyon/file/api.py`
- [x] Create `pyon/file/__init__.py` to expose `File` from `api`
- [x] Ensure `from pyon.file import File` works as expected
- [x] Refactor imports across project to reflect new structure

#### ‚úÖ Documentation Bootstrap
- [x] Create standalone `README.md` for `pyon/file` submodule
- [x] Include version badge, GitHub links, license, and summary
- [x] Document current public interface of `File` (pre-refactor)
- [x] Provide example usage consistent with Pyon serialization
- [x] Plan for migration to future interface (0.3.x)

### Known Limitations

- Shared and cyclical references are not yet supported.
- Binary output and encryption are pending implementation.
- No support yet for deep ML structures like `torch.Tensor`, `tf.Tensor`, `networkx.Graph`, or `scipy.sparse`.

### Next Steps

The next version will be **0.3.0-alpha**, focused on extending the `File` interface and preparing it for general-purpose file management.

Key goals include:

- üìÇ **Stream Support**: Implement chunked and line-by-line reading via `stream()` and `to_stream()` interfaces.
- üåê **Remote File Access**: Introduce `from_url()` to create `File` instances directly from HTTP(S) sources.
- ‚úÖ **Existence and Status Checks**: Expand metadata and introspection via properties like `exists`, `status`, and `is_loaded`.
- üîÑ **Export Control**: Continue refining the `export_mode` mechanism to ensure predictable serialization behavior.
- üß™ **Dedicated Testing**: Isolate `pyon.file` tests to its own suite, ensuring maintainability and clarity.
- üìö **Module Documentation**: Expand the `README.md` of `pyon.file` to reflect upcoming additions, with code samples and guidelines.

These changes aim to make the `File` class a self-contained and expressive abstraction for both serialized and disk-based content, without deviating from Pyon's core principles: deterministic behavior, secure deserialization, and clear object boundaries.

## Versioning Notes

This project follows semantic versioning principles:
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
- Pre-release versions are suffixed with `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc`.

For example:
- `0.2.0-alpha`: Current alpha release (dict keys + hashing + protected/private support).
- `0.3.0-alpha`: Next alpha, introducing reference handling for shared/cyclic objects.
- `1.0.0-beta`: First beta release with full core and safety features.
- `1.0.0`: First production-ready release.
