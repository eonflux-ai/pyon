# Pyon Project Summary

## **Current Status**

### **Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
- Provides serialization and deserialization for a wide range of Python types.  
- Supports recursive encoding and decoding of deeply nested structures.
- Limited to string keys for dictionaries, with no support for cyclical or shared references.  
- Automated tests focused solely on the public API.

---

## **Next Immediate Steps**

### **0.1.1-alpha**  
- Improve testing coverage to include modules beyond the public API.

### **0.2.0-alpha**  
- Enable support for dictionaries with keys of any data type.

### **0.3.0-alpha**  
- Implement cyclical reference detection and handling.  
- Optimize shared reference serialization.

---

## **Planned Features**

- Support for new data types, including tensors, graphs, and sparse structures.
- Binary compression and encryption for enhanced security and efficiency.
- Modular and extensible framework to support future data types and features.

---

## **Project Structure**

- Encoders organized by data type (base, collections, numeric, etc.).
- Structured tests to validate functionality and maintain integrity.

---

## **Next Tasks**

1. Refactor and expand tests to increase coverage.
2. Implement hash dictionary for shared references during serialization.
3. Develop cyclical reference detection and handling mechanisms.
