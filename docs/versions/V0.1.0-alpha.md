# Pyon Versioning

## Current Version: 0.1.0-alpha

### Status
Alpha (Mature)

### Overview
This version of Pyon represents significant progress in implementing key functionalities while acknowledging that the project is still in an experimental stage. \
The primary focus remains on completing the core roadmap and ensuring stability before transitioning to Beta.

### Key Features in 0.1.0-alpha

- Comprehensive serialization and deserialization for a wide range of Python types, including:
  - **Base Types**: `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `None`.
  - **Numeric Types**: `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`.
  - **Collection Types**: `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`.
    - From `collections`: `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`.
  - **Datetime Types**: `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`.
  - **Mapping Types**: `class` (user-defined classes), `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dict`, `Enum`.
  - **Specialized Types**: 
    - `bitarray.bitarray`, `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `pyon.File`, `uuid.UUID`.

- Recursive encoding and decoding.
- Robust encode/decode functionality with extensibility for future data types.
- Automated test of the public api, ensuring functionality for all supported types.

### Known Limitations
- Only public api being tested.
- Dicts accept only string keys.
- Cyclical reference handling is not yet implemented.
- Shared references are not optimized, potentially leading to redundant serialization.
- Encryption and binary compression features are pending implementation.
- Support for additional data types (e.g., tensors, graph structures) is planned but not yet available.

### Next Steps
The next version (0.1.1-alpha) will focus on:
- Organizing tests.
- Create tests for other modules of the project.

The version (0.2.0-alpha) will focus on:
- Dicts having any type of key.

The version (0.3.0-alpha) will focus on:
- Implementing cyclical reference detection and handling.
- Adding initial support for shared reference optimization.

## Versioning Notes
This project follows semantic versioning principles:
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
- Pre-release versions are suffixed with `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc`.

For example:
- `0.1.0-alpha`: Current alpha release.
- `0.2.0-alpha`: Next planned alpha with new features.
- `1.0.0-beta`: Initial beta release, signaling readiness for broader feedback.
- `1.0.0`: First stable release.

## Feedback and Contribution
This version is suitable for internal testing and experimentation. Feedback is welcome to shape the roadmap and future enhancements.
